RELEASE NOTES FOR SLURM VERSION 20.02

IMPORTANT NOTES:
If using the slurmdbd (Slurm DataBase Daemon) you must update this first.

NOTE: If using a backup DBD you must start the primary first to do any
database conversion, the backup will not start until this has happened.

The 20.02 slurmdbd will work with Slurm daemons of version 18.08 and above.
You will not need to update all clusters at the same time, but it is very
important to update slurmdbd first and having it running before updating
any other clusters making use of it.

Slurm can be upgraded from version 18.08 or 19.05 to version 20.02 without loss
of jobs or other state information. Upgrading directly from an earlier version
of Slurm will result in loss of state information.

If using SPANK plugins that use the Slurm APIs, they should be recompiled when
upgrading Slurm to a new major release.

NOTE: Slurmctld is now set to fatal in case of computing node configured with
      CPUs == #Sockets. CPUs has to be either total number of cores or threads.

HIGHLIGHTS
==========
 -- Drop slurm.spec-legacy from distribution.
 -- Removed the smap command.
 -- Exclusive behavior of a node includes all GRES on a node as well
    as the cpus.


- Added slurm.conf option MaxDBDMsgs to control how many messages will be
  stored in the slurmctld before throwing them away when the slurmdbd is down.
